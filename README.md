# Vibe
Music streaming platform for the deaf.

### Prerequisites
- npm
- React
- Spotify Web API

### Known Issues
- Vibration only works on Android for about 10-15 seconds
- Currently only works on one song (until OAuth issue is resolved)

### In Progress
- Separate the JavaScript vibration engine and make it an npm package
- Migrate from React to React Native to avoid vibration limits
- Manage OAuth and make Vibe work with other Spotify features
